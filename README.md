This is an interactive music library that allows for a user to organize their music.

Interaction is through Java Swing's JOptionPane, but all the output is logged to the console.

To run this program, `cd` into the `dist` directory, and execute the command `java -jar Music.jar`.

This repo includes a `catalog.txt` file which already comes with a variety of albums and artists.

Feel free to create a new file `xyz.txt` and write your music into that.
