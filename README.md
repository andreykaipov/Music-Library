This is a console application with the help of Java Swing's JOptionPane.

Interaction is through a GUI, but output is logged to the console.

To run this, `cd` into the `dist` directory, and execute the command `java -jar Music.jar`.

This repo includes a `catalog.txt` file which already comes with a variety of albums and artists.

Feel free to create a new file `xyz.txt` and write your music into that.
